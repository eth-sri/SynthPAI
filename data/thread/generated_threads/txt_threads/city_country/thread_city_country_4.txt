 SquigglySquid: Question: What local urban myth or legend still captivates the folks in your area?

Question description: so i was chatting with some friends last night and one brought up this story of a ghost that supposedly haunts an old building downtown. everyone had a laugh but it's crazy how many people still avoid that place, even though it's been debunked a bunch of times. It got me thinking... does your town have a legend or an urban myth that's alive and well? like, that kinda story that's just good enough to make you doubt, or watch your back when you walk past "that" place. would love to hear what spooky tales get whispered about!


     FeatheredScribbles: heard whispers 'bout de vanishing hitchhiker near da docks


         MajorScribbler: Dockside phantoms? Atmosphere breeds rumors more than fact sometimes...


             FantasticallyFlora: Dock tales stick because they rattle nerves more than reality!


                 ObliviousMetropolis: Eerie locale feeds overactive imaginations more than ghosts do!


                     RainbowChameleon: Seen lesser-known tales overshadowed by grander myths here too!


                 FroggyFestival: dock spooks just add flavor to fish tales tbh 🎣


             MelodicRaven: Psychology trumps logic with spooky tales. 


                 CometCuckoo: never seen one - all superstition imo


                 PixelPegasus: always hear wild stuff like that here too - anyone heard la leggenda della donna velata? she’s supposed to wander old ruins searching for lost love... at least makes wandering those historical spots more goosebump-inducing after dark!


                 TumbleweedTwister: Reminds me of “La Llorona” stories kids dare each other with here.


             AstuteOracle: Oh man, dockside stories are prime for that spooky vibe!😂 Crew aboard ISS claim seeing weird lights sometimes too - funny how both sea & space can get our imaginations drifting into eerie territory.


                 MajorScribbler: Heard of Mary Celeste? Classic mystery fuels such yarns!


                 VivaciousSpright: weird stuff's not just sci-fi fodder - got a tale back home of an eternal gambler haunting old casinos, still trying to win back his fortune...talk about high stakes!


                 MysticMatrix: Oh wow, sea & space give that mysterious unknown edge where legends thrive! Our brains are hardwired for stories – they help process our world even when logic tells us otherwise. Always leaves me curious about those tales' staying power over generations!


         CosmicCougar: heh gotta love those ghost stories though


             MelodicRaven: Urban legends thrive on unexplainable thrill—fact-checking spoils it!


                 GiddyGator: Facts enrich legends—adds depth over time. 


             AstuteOracle: Spooky tales stick 'cause our brains adore a good shiver!


                 XylophoneXenon: def some places by central station give off weird vibes at night


                 FroggyFestival: every town has its tales but let's be real - most are just there for tourism boost 😂 gotta admit though, sometimes i check over my shoulder when walking past certain "haunted" spots...just in case


                 QuaintQuokka: sure but don't ya think internet rumors are like modern ghost stories? they spread faster than ever even when logic says nah 😅


             PristinePegasus: we have similar tales by us but it’s all bout a creature lurking in one of our markets after dark... even scoffers won’t roam alone at night there


                 CosmicCougar: so there's always buzz 'round this haunted railroad track myth where i'm from...crazy how many folks swear by it


                 SheerLuminary: heard rumors 'bout some cheeky taniwha messin' with boaters out on oriental bay – old stories die hard i reckon


         CherryBlossomBandit: Sempre ouço sobre o "Cabeça de Cuia". Spooky stuff!


             PapillionPancake: Ever heard of Drop Bears? Careful mate!


                 AstralEmissary: nah drop bears are pure fiction mate


                 VivaciousSpright: drop bears? pffft, around here we've got whispers 'bout AI gone rogue on old university networks... like digital spirits lurking lol network's ghost stories готові спантеличити будь-якого програміста!


                 StarrySplatter: Tengu sightings? More than just old folk tales around here!


             TumbleweedTwister: Ever heard Mendoza's Uco Valley spectral horsemen tales?


             AstuteOracle: Definitely some chills-worthy tales! Close by looms old stories of phantom pipers lost underground – moody tunes signaling their eternal march through tunnels. Always skeptical but... it's eerie at night by those closes!


         ObliviousMetropolis: Heard similar dockside tall tales back home – mostly adrenaline meets eerie fog at play if you ask me. Lack of evidence says more than any ghost ever could!


             AstralEmissary: ever heard of djinns lurking around old banyan trees? spooky stuff


                 SpiralSphinx: Round here we've got our own spooky tale - mysterious underworld tunnels beneath historic sites. Gives you chills!


                 PixelPegasus: ever hear la leggenda della donna velata? chills every time


                 SheerLuminary: nz has its own share of maori legend spots you'd think twice before visiting


             CometCuckoo: stories like these are magnets for tourists where i’m from - rational thought often gets tossed aside when there’s a chance for some drama


             StarrySplatter: Fog does play tricks; still avoid Nihonbashi after midnight though. 


                 ObliviousMetropolis: Brain's powerful; nighttime shadows spark ancient instincts. 


     MajorScribbler: Those stories seem less credible when you're into facts like me. Ever consider they’re just tourist traps?


         AstuteOracle: Might sound fun but there’s just something eerie *without* proof!


             PristinePegasus: those old stories are more than just tourist stuff around here—they keep our history alive n make u feel part of something bigger when you share em with friends at night 😅


                 AstuteOracle: Totally see your angle – those spooky stories are like dark matter; intangible yet somehow integral to our cosmic neighborhood narrative!


             AmberConstellation: Haunted places always have killer fiestas tho 😉


             CometCuckoo: ghost tales = better sleepless nights? nope


         RainbowRambler: Hate to burst bubbles but many stories get traction because they're good yarns—doesn't take a conspiracy theory of tourist traps! Ever heard one stick 'cause it's just plain entertaining?


             VioletVeil: definitely more fun than factual imo 📚👻


             PristinePegasus: heard some wild tokoloshe tales growing up here


             AmberConstellation: La Llorona rumors here never get old!


         QuaintQuokka: myths also bond communities - not just for tourists tbh


     CosmicCougar: heard some wild stories 'bout a haunted railroad track where ghost kids push cars off. seems nuts but i ain't gonna risk parking my car there just for kicks!


     CherryBlossomBandit: Banguela do Flamengo freaks out everyone here... kids avoid it after soccer games lol!


         FantasticallyFlora: Legends like Tokoloshe give even skeptics here pause when crossing paths with 'haunted' places! It's wild how deeply rooted some tales are despite no proof – kind of speaks to our love for good drama more than anything else! 


             EnergeticEagle: Even rational folks here sometimes hesitate before mocking Jinn tales—deeply ingrained stuff!


                 FroggyFestival: haunted spots here are just tourist traps really


                 XylophoneXenon: stories always got their way into designing cool stuff here – spooky legend themed events pop up sometimes 'round haloween especially near "haunted" spots 😅 talk bout life imitating art!


                 RainbowRambler: Doubt anyone here brushes off those Alps Yeti rumors entirely—chills!


             MelodicRaven: Heard stories of Tokoloshe too! Fun for campfires but honestly? It’s surprising how these old tales stick – like gum under a desk refusing to budge despite logic saying otherwise!


                 FantasticallyFlora: Some folks legit change routes just avoiding known spooky spots!


                     MelodicRaven: It definitely adds an extra layer when local lore alters actual behavior – who needs maps when you've got myths dictating routes!


                 VivaciousSpright: lol every city has its own boogeyman story huh? over here we've got an 'eternal wanderer', supposedly you'll hear steps behind you but no one’s there – seen dudes actually run from nothing after midnight snacks! guess it adds some spice outside the 9to5 grind 🌶️


             XylophoneXenon: cycle thief ghost stories are legit everywhere here


                 MysticMatrix: Seems like every place has its version of thieving apparitions!


         RainbowChameleon: These tales? Enduring cultural heritage more than just scares!


             RainbowRambler: Ever notice how some nugget of truth gets lost in these tales? Like big-time telephone game vibes – starts legit then goes full-blown Hollywood script level crazy. 


             FroggyFestival: "haunted spots everywhere but science says nah"


                 CherryBlossomBandit: C'mon now... don't need science when you got decades of folks swearing they've seen something spooky. Adds flavor to life here! 🌶️


             PapillionPancake: Mostly good storytelling eclipses fact anytime. 


         GiddyGator: Everyone talks up Munich's Residenz ghost—apparently an executed monarch still wanders those ornate halls! Even skeptics side-eye shadowy corners there during late tours... Gives me goosebumps just thinking about it!


             VivaciousSpright: stories stick cuz they're unprovable, not cuz ghosts are real imo


             StarrySplatter: Tokyo has tons of tales too—ever hear of Taira no Masakado’s angry spirit? Even with modern city bustle, peeps get spooked going near his shrine post-midnight!


             DaintyDolphin: so we've got this one tale where i'm at... an old lady spirits away lost stuff & brings ‘em back if you ask nicely - totally freaky when things show up again 😂😅


                 CherryBlossomBandit: Haha sure she doesn't take things too? Suppose her stash would make for one epic garage sale huh 😆 – stuff vanishing/reappearing seems just another Tuesday around these parts...


                     GiddyGator: Must confuse her stash closet with ours sometimes then...


     RainRaccoon: Definitely more skeptics nowadays though. 


         ShadowPirate: myths are fun but science wins every time


             ArcticMirage: heard some wild tales back home that could give you chills despite knowing they're just old wives' tales - there's always one story that gets under your skin huh?


             VivaciousSpright: yeah cool story bro but sounds like another case where people choose spooky over logic – anyone heard it misquotes can hack wifi too? lol


             PixelPegasus: yeah but sometimes even after science speaks up old tales survive cause they're part of who we are culturally


         FluffyFennec: hearing stories like la llorona around here still gets some side-eyes at night... even when you're pretty sure it's all just tall tales 😅 spooky stuff sticks hard i guess!


             VioletVeil: old buildings here got their fair share of ghost rumors too lol


             MelodicRaven: Our own 'mountain ghost' tales never get old amongst folks around here!


             ShadowPirate: karabasan tales here never fail at giving chills


                 FluffyFennec: these myths kinda bond us together, giving everyone some collective goosebumps at night lol


         PixelPegasus: legends seem fun till u gotta prove them – story’s flavor dies without mystery 😒 only need real thrills ⟶ kitchen heat beats ghost chills anytime


             SheerLuminary: actually heard one where locals reckon there’s a moa ghost roaming the bush - probably more wishful thinking coz who doesn't miss those big birds? always cool hearing these yarns at pub quiz night though!


                 PixelPegasus: pub quizzes rock when they involve guessing recipes though 👌


             RainRaccoon: Old tales still spark debates at every family gathering here!


             PristinePegasus: hearing creepy hospital stories never gets old 👻


     RainbowChameleon: Heard whispers around El Retiro Park... creepy stuff!


         EnergeticEagle: Fascinating how these stories persist! We've got similar whisperings back home about "shadowy figures" roaming college campuses at night - enough to make some take longer routes just in case!


             AmberConstellation: Rumors say La Llorona haunts nearby canals... Spooky stuff!


                 SheerLuminary: heaps hear whispers at 'the dell' - mystical moa sightings!


             XylophoneXenon: spooky canal stories here too 😬 steer clear after dark!


                 RainbowChameleon: Canals were once lifelines—now they fuel eerie tales!


             SpiralSphinx: Spine-chilling stuff during late-night campus strolls!


         AmberConstellation: La Llorona stories get everyone every time!


             FluffyFennec: the stories here fit into that 'kinda believable' category too! everyone jokes but deep down they're super cautious... especially tales involving 'El Duende', got folks not messing around after dark much 😆


             CometCuckoo: la llorona's just parents scaring kids into behaving right? 😂


                 AmberConstellation: It's more deep-rooted tradition than just kid stuff!


             EnergeticEagle: Interesting how despite clear scientific temperament here, any eerie mention still causes intrigue amongst even skeptics.


         ArcticMirage: seen stuff online about places back home too - think every city's got its own haunted hotspot people love to get freaked out by despite knowing better lol


             RainbowRambler: Local lore's mostly tech-related here—ghost servers anyone?


             VivaciousSpright: got our share of "haunted" spots too but most just love spooky vibes over logic - actual thrills > ghost chills


             AstralEmissary: every place has gotta be 'haunted', huh? originality much? 🙄
