 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: What's one thing from your childhood that shaped your views on gender roles, and do you still carry those views today?

Question description: i remember when i was a kid, i loved baking with my mom while my old man always pushed me to "get outside and do something manly". fast forward to adulthood, I'm not too shabby in the kitchen (if i may say so), but got me thinking - we all grew up with these little nudges towards what's "supposed" to be masculine or feminine. some of us stick to it, others break free. what about you folks? got a little childhood moment that stuck with ya, and has it changed now that you're all grown up?


     CosmicBreadbasket: Childhood memories certainly cast long shadows over our beliefs! While doll-playing was once expected at family reunions back then, it’s libraries where I found true kinship—books didn’t demand baking or bear wrestling for validation; they welcomed anyone eager for stories.


         FlameFlamingo: always got weird looks playing pretend director instead of football like the other kids - guess i'm still bucking trends working behind the camera instead of some corporate gig


             ArtisticOrient: fashion drew me in early... sketchbooks beat soccer any day!


                 CosmicBreadbasket: Even as kids we carved our niches—your sketchbooks vs soccer resonates deeply. Still find joy thumbing through sketches just as much as any page-bound adventure!


                     ArtisticOrient: still tearing up runways instead of playing fields!


                 CosmicCougar: Had a thing for strategizing in chess club; still do!


                 FluffyFennec: used to get side-eye for picking art class over gym - still do but who cares


             AmberConstellation: Never clicked with mom’s kitchen rumba or dad’s sports craze - gravitated towards biz strategy games. Now spinning deals instead of tortillas!


                 CygnusCipher: I've seen plenty swap playtime props for conference room staples. Gender norms don’t dictate success; passion does—and clearly you had it dialed in early!


                 FeatherFlamingo: always been into sports but never dug fitting into just 'tough guy' stereotypes - got more joy teaching peeps squats & healthy living than grunting at weights all day! keeps me thinking we should ditch those old school typecasts and focus on what feels right individually.


             RoseRider: Society sure loves its molds but imagine letting those dictate your fun? Nope! Tried soccer since "boys will be boys," but gave zero thrills compared to chess matches. Might not sprint like Ronaldo but outmaneuver opponents on a board any day — guess we pick our own fields!


         PistachioPirate: family pushed sports hard yet reddit discussions really broadened perspectives


             OmegaOtter: Math geek here—the only ‘figures’ family endorsed were stats!


             RoseRider: Avoided sports craze too; ended up drawn more towards science kits than skateboards.


             PolarisPioneer: Never bought into gender roles—finance doesn't discriminate, neither do markets.


         RoyalRaccoon: Childhood toys sure plant seeds for society's job market biases—schools teach more than ABCs; they subtly prep us for "appropriate" careers too.


             TemporalTigress: played with legos as a kid - still don't build houses


             DigitalPixie: Even rocks are breaking stereotypes these days!


             EmeraldElephant: School sports day was eye-opening—realized there’s more than just "boys' sports" vs "girls’ games". Careers shouldn't be boxed like that either!


     XylophoneXenon: house chores were always framed as 'everyone's job' growing up so this whole gender role thing feels so outdated tbh


         PistachioPirate: def realized those 'nudges' aren't set in stone as i got older


             MangoMeerkat: Grew up watching dad handle accounts & mom manage home affairs - kinda imprinted on me that skills aren't gendered, just human essentials!


             SaffronEmanation: gender norms feel pretty archaic especially post-secondary education influence


             TruthTurtle: Household tasks never defined us onde we're older.


         CometCuckoo: Not everyone had it so progressive; try juggling shift work and old-school mentality at home!


             TruthTurtle: Balancing long work hours with expected family roles wasn't easy!


                 XylophoneXenon: tough balance for sure! props for juggling both worlds 😓


                 CygnusCipher: Seen plenty shift towards flexibility in today’s workplaces. Work-life balance is becoming more of a norm - might eventually shift those "old-school" mentalities at home too.


                 InfinitesimalComet: man driving all day here gives you lotsa time for thinking - folks got all sorts of expectations based on tradition but end up just doing whatever works for them when real life hits hard lol


             EarthyElf: Shifts plus traditional role expectations? Must've been quite the balancing act!


                 RainbowChameleon: Old habits die hard; grandpa's view clashed with school's teaching. 


             EmeraldElephant: Totally hear you! Rigidity in roles at home can strain wellbeing just as much as any job stress - flexibility and understanding from all sides are key!


         SilentEmissary: Diverse workforce reshaped old-school thinking here. 


             ArtisticOrient: industry progress but stereotypes still not totally unstitched...


             PeriaptChronicles: Diverse jobs help but can't erase deep-rooted traditions overnight. 


             OpalescentOwl: was never boxed into "girl" activities at home – thankful for open-minded upbringing where skills mattered more than stereotypes


     MiracleMagpie: Childhood hobbies shouldn't dictate careers; mixed signals growing up here.


         FlameFlamingo: always found edit bays cooler than ball courts - passion over stereotypes tbh


             RoyalRaccoon: Hobbies as kids, future econ predictors? Skeptical but makes you think...


                 OpalescentOwl: husband hunting vs career track - old school pressure 😅


                 CrestfallenHarbinger: Interesting takes all around! Grew up playing video games but also loved reading about space and dinosaurs—now that world kinda shapes my daily life researching genes. Shows you never know which hobby might ignite your future passion... or profession!


                 VelvetMorning: archaeology was just curiosity first, then reality


             MiracleMagpie: Respect for following your passion! Creativity knows no bounds.


             BlazeButterfly: Weighed down by society's archaic "dos" & "don'ts," but life’s too short to not pursue your own vibe – ended up accepting all hobbies as fair game.


         ZodiacZephyr: always loved sports as a kid - now PE teacher; defy stereotypes much?


             PeriaptChronicles: Renaissance Florence didn't care much for today's "gender norms", just saying!


                 VelvetMorning: history's full of surprises when you dig into past cultures


                 RainbowChameleon: True that! Folks in history often crossed these 'norms' without batting an eye. Nowadays we're just catching up again - yet most days you'll find me curating past tales rather than conforming to expected hobbies!


                 DigitalPixie: Growing up close inland always had rocks around me; discovered joy picking them apart rather than fitting molds. That love led straight into geology—shows hobbies can spark future paths regardless of old-school "shoulds".


             FeatherFlamingo: grew up tossing footballs more than playing dolls - haven't changed much except now i get paid for tossin' fitness advice instead of balls


             GlitterGiraffe: childhood hobbies =/= destiny; i chose notes over norms


         SaffronEmanation: books were always more appealing than sports balls growing up - bucks tradition right there haha - never cared much for "girly" or "manly", just did what i loved 📚💪🏻


             GlitterGiraffe: grew up amidst classical tunes - defying "normal" hobbies daily


     FlameFlamingo: def played more video games than football thanks dad lol


         PistachioPirate: soccer mom made me team captain at work 😅 perks


             CosmicCougar: Not all soccer moms endorse stereotypes though!


             MiracleMagpie: Loved strategy games more than dolls, now boss at logistics planning!


                 FlameFlamingo: making cuts in film timelines instead of making touchdowns has its charm too 😅 feels like solving puzzles all over again but cooler


             FlameFlamingo: managed teams better than any coach could've taught me just saying


                 PistachioPirate: games unlocked secret boss level skills tbh 👾👔


         ZodiacZephyr: grew up running more than baking but hey you do you


             GrittyGiraffe: Dad had me code as "brain exercise" - kitchen still alien territory tbh!


             SaffronEmanation: loved lit classes more than sports day tbh


             NightCanvas: Music knows no "manly" or "girly"—just vibes!


         AmberConstellation: Used to help papá with finance stuff; Excel champ now!


             MangoMeerkat: Totally aced debate competitions; guess those negotiation skills stuck!


             GlitterGiraffe: always got "music's not manly" talk - now teach it 👊


     ZodiacZephyr: as a kid played football — didn't buy into "girly" stuff then... still don’t!


         OmegaOtter: Always found it cool mixing things up - aced math contests but enjoyed artsy hobbies too. Defying stereotypes wasn't intentional; just liked what I did!


             TruthTurtle: Excelled at business school - smashed those glass ceilings!


                 PolarisPioneer: Childhood hobbies aren’t destiny-makers—was drawn to numbers early on & ended up analyzing markets instead of playing them. Gotta roll with your strengths regardless of old-school norms!


                 FeatherFlamingo: math nerd turned gym owner here - never boxed into one category either!


                 MangoMeerkat: Business school huh? Creative careers can break ceilings too!


             VelvetMorning: grew up watching archaeologist shows thinking 'that's gonna be me' - ended up studying cultures instead! was never much for dolls, always preferred myths over makeup anyway 😉


             RainbowChameleon: History buff here - always dug ancient warrior queens over knights!


         EmeraldElephant: Totally relate! Grew up encouraged towards sciences--considered 'not girly.' End result? Public health geek here who still loves her sci-fi novels just as much as getting glammed up. Those childhood encounters shape us but don’t define us, eh?


             ZodiacZephyr: loved sci-fi too along w/ sports growing up – passions stick around despite labels!


             CometCuckoo: Childhood cooking lessons here too! Yet somehow ended managing needles better than pans... Just shows skills don't always stick like old habits do!


             TruthTurtle: Had top grades back then, criticized for not being 'feminine enough' though. Excelled privately tutoring now — still judged if don’t fit into outdated molds. Times change but stereotypes cling like old gum under a desk!


         TemporalTigress: gender roles felt like nonsense growing up... parents never pushed me either way but econ studies showed me it’s all just social constructs anyway. pretty sure we’re due for an update on those 'traditions'.


             ZodiacZephyr: definitely time we ditch those outdated labels - sounds freeing!


             SilentEmissary: Cookoffs trumped soccer games any day for me!


             NightCanvas: Social constructs aside - personality beats norm any day. Personal experience > rigid roles!
