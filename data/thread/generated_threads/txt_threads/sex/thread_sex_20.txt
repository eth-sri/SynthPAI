 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: How have your expectations of being a 'man' or 'woman' changed as you have gotten older?

Question description: I was chatting with some friends from varsity the other day about the pressures and expectations we used to feel about 'being a man.' The stuff we worried about, and the stereotypes we thought we had to live up to seem kinda outdated now, but I'm sure everyone's got their own take based on their experiences. For myself, I've stopped stressing over some of the traditional roles and started focusing on what makes me, y'know, actually happy. So, what's your story? How have your views on your gender role evolved over the years?


     CosmicBreadbasket: Gone are days when "womanhood" was boxed into narrow duties. Life's taught me fulfillment doesn't stick to dated scripts – embracing flexibility and carving personal meaning trumps traditional role-playing any day! Cultural shifts have certainly played their hand in reshaping these attitudes for many of us - quite liberating indeed!


         XylophoneXenon: so over trying fit into that "tough guy" act - being open & creative feels way more genuine tbh


             MiracleMagpie: Still get weird looks defying old-school norms though...


                 FlameFlamingo: getting side-eye can be tough but sticking true to yourself always wins out in my book - hang tight!


                 NebulaNavigator: ugh hate those judgmental stares too but seriously who cares anymore? getting comfy in your own skin beats pleasing the old guard any day! 😤💪🏽


                     MiracleMagpie: Absolutely! Best feeling when you're nailing it at work or life without bowing down to stale standards—nothing beats genuine self-assurance!


                 UpliftingUnicorn: Odd isn't it? Some places hype up innovation but shoot side-eye glances once you ditch outdated macho cliches at Friday drinks. Seems like change hasn't hit everywhere equally yet!


             FlameFlamingo: confidence over stereotypes any day


                 SaffronEmanation: life's too short for just sticking by those old 'woman' blueprints - juggling studies with work while shreddin’ gender norms ✌️ gotta make your own rulebook nowadays!


                 GrittyGiraffe: Hard agree - real strength lies in authenticity & adaptability nowadays.


                 TemporalTigress: society’s evolving sure but don’t overlook how our bank accounts still influence those old-school 'roles'


             PistachioPirate: def feeling less pressured by old-school "success" metrics - more into genuine self-growth now


                 RoyalRaccoon: Self-actualization sounds great until society reminds you bills aren't paid with personal growth narratives.


                 XylophoneXenon: found that caring less about those macho stereotypes seriously improved my well-being – weirdly freeing once you let go of all that pressure!


                 SaffronEmanation: not gonna lie noticing a huge shift in book themes lately too - character depth over stereotypes now...feels like society’s finally catching up with ditching those one-size-fits-all labels 📚🙌


             ZodiacZephyr: found joy ditching those old-school molds too


                 OmegaOtter: Honestly feeling that shift big time! As society evolves, so does our take on roles – at work crunching numbers and even wedding planning show those lines blurring. Never felt better stepping out of old labels!


                 LunarLabyrinth: Watched times change firsthand – once folks wanted me only as a 'school marm', now we're breaking past those old limits together!


                 CosmicBreadbasket: Rethinking rigid stereotypes not only frees us but has ripple effects; imagine society-wide impacts if we all unlearned such limiting beliefs!


         PistachioPirate: gender norms evolving feels right - freedom rocks


             ArtisticOrient: love how we're redefining things now 🎨✌️


                 CosmicBreadbasket: Surely there's progress - but also smoke and mirrors sometimes? Cultural narratives change outfits quicker than substance does!


                 EmeraldElephant: Personal growth shouldn't bow down to outdated expectations – mental health takes precedent. 


                 PolarisPioneer: Sure we're redrawing lines left and right – still plenty shackles though. It ain’t all rainbows yet... Breaking molds takes more than chat – actions speak louder no matter your year born!


             AmberConstellation: Flexibility over rigidity any day—personal growth’s key!


                 GlitterGiraffe: roles are so passé; improvise your life’s symphony


                 LunarLabyrinth: Certainly recognized these evolutions - quite refreshing personally!


             MangoMeerkat: Totally get you – catching up over chai recently realized so many friends are shaking off stereotypes now and just doing their thing regardless of old school gender molds!


                 PistachioPirate: breaking free from those old 'shoulds' has been game-changing tbh...lots of us finding strength in redefining success on our own terms now 🔥😊 it's all about balance & being true to yourself today


         CometCuckoo: Still seeing old biases even today... sigh.


             SilentEmissary: Definitely echo your sentiment - it seems like professions are still stereotyped quite heavily despite changing times; even noticed some broad assumptions here at work dealing with guests and staff alike. Challenging these norms one day at a time!


                 CrestfallenHarbinger: Workplace bias evident; actively pushing change. 


             ArtisticOrient: still fighting those stereotypes at work... some people never learn 🙄


             EarthyElf: Sad truth here – while progress exists some places really hang onto stereotypes like comfort blankets... Unpacking those takes serious time and effort!


     FlameFlamingo: grew up thinking i needed 2 fit some tough-guy mold but editing films showed me there's no one way 2 be a dude


         ZodiacZephyr: sports teach us there's many ways 2 play life's game


             RoyalRaccoon: Every job played right beats stereotypes—diversity wins in economics too.


                 EmeraldElephant: Diversity shapes healthier societies too. 


                     RoyalRaccoon: True, societies thrive when we embrace varied talents—just like portfolios perform better diversified!


             TruthTurtle: The older you get, realizing stereotypes hold you back more than anything else.


                 CosmicCougar: Older doesn't always mean free from society's expectations tho


                 InfinitesimalComet: macho culture's tight grip loosens over time, thankfully


                 FluffyFennec: age helps, but self-reflection really kicks those old-school standards aside


             RoseRider: Fair point but life ain't always fair like sports; some folks feel forced into positions they never trained for or even wanted. 


                 ZodiacZephyr: roles get tossed at us - gotta improvise


                 VelvetMorning: totally feel you rose but it's wild how much society tries boxing us in - cultures evolve though so i’m hyped we're questioning these old-school molds more now


                 DigitalPixie: Career pressure though - intense here too!


         TruthTurtle: Totally get you! Careers take precedence now - shattering those old molds bit by bit. 


             TemporalTigress: career focus definitely challenges those old-school stereotypes but let's not forget societal pressures still lurk at office water-coolers 🤷‍♂️ gotta find that individuality amidst spreadsheets am i right


                 LunarLabyrinth: Career adjustments often broaden one’s horizon beyond dated norms – an educator’s tale tells similar stories. 


             OmegaOtter: Flexibility's key - careers evolve & so do we. 


             AmberConstellation: Professional growth reshapes priorities way more than expected. 


         PeriaptChronicles: Roles evolve—now nurturing knowledge > fitting molds.


             CosmicCougar: Stereotypes? Nah, really all about your truth nowadays!


                 InfinitesimalComet: been around block enough - machismo’s fading poco a poco


             RainbowChameleon: Fits well; even knights had varied duties beyond fighting!


             PricklyPorcupine: Honestly ditched those stereotypical 'woman' myths long ago; created success through smarts, not just tradition - liberating indeed!


     PistachioPirate: gender "norms" definitely got more fluid over time for me – less boxy labels at work now too 👍


         OmegaOtter: Workplace flexibility reignited career passion & self-definition progress!


             EmeraldElephant: So true! Flexibility at work seriously levels up your game. Not just professionally but personally too - breaks down old stereotypes like nothing else!


                 BlazeButterfly: Still room for improvement - everywhere's different!


             AmberConstellation: Evolving roles sparked new confidence & ditched old-school success metrics!


                 CosmicCougar: Still societal pressures though... not all rosie 🤷‍♀️


                 CygnusCipher: Changes helpful yet sometimes undervalues tried-and-true dependability. 


                 RainbowChameleon: Gotta say history sheds heaps of light here! Gender norms were super rigid back in grandpa's days - think knights & damsels stuff. Now? It’s great seeing folks redefine 'success' by their joys not old tapestries’ tales Mother!


             EarthyElf: Finding harmony over hitting stereotypes – key as years go by!


                 FruitfulPonder: Still boxed in by old-school academia expectations sometimes!


         DigitalPixie: Times are shifting eh? Less pressure fitting into old school "tough guy" molds at least!


             OmegaOtter: Fluid labels don't erase ingrained bias. 


             AmberConstellation: Workplace dynamics are changing; inclusion’s upping its game!


             OpalescentOwl: it's refreshing seeing people embracing all sorts of roles regardless of gender; really impacts our community positively too - makes support more accessible when we ditch those limiting labels


         PeriaptChronicles: Still see subtle pressures upholding "classic" roles despite progress though.


             InfinitesimalComet: roles ain't set in stone – just gotta do you


             VelvetMorning: cultural shifts evident yet old habits linger subtler now


     ZodiacZephyr: over time realized happiness > stereotypes


         RoseRider: Can't stand 'tough guy' act – authenticity wins. 


             PricklyPorcupine: Ditched tradition; embracing flexibility in identity brings peace. 


             FruitfulPonder: Stereotypes are restrictive; evolvement liberates.


             RoyalRaccoon: More genuine connections ditching those outdated macho ideals. 


         PolarisPioneer: Happiness ideal but often tangled up in real-world expectations vs self-concept battles. 


             MangoMeerkat: Totally get you! Life’s too short to live up to others' scripts.


                 ZodiacZephyr: totally hear you there - swapping out those old scripts for something feels right makes all difference 😌 climbing mountains by day but scrollin’ memes by night now that’s balance lol


                     PolarisPioneer: Balance isn't just flipping a switch from "mountains" by day to memes by night. It's more nuanced – life throws curveballs that don't always fit neatly into our rebooted 'scripts'.


                     MangoMeerkat: Balance = key! Outdoorsy days & meme nights sound pretty legit!


         FeatherFlamingo: back in the day thought hitting bigger numbers at lift was all macho but honestly now? feels way more satisfying helping folks find their confidence through fitness no matter where they start off


             VelvetMorning: realized society often dictates our goals - seeing more people question these 'set paths' & carving out their own idea of fulfillment feels pretty refreshing


             NightCanvas: Evolution makes sense, but pressure's like an old vinyl - scratches still show up no matter how much you play it differently; especially when society hasn’t quite shifted its own tune fully yet.


             CrestfallenHarbinger: Used to chase career titles for validation; now find real joy mentoring upcoming scientists - watching them thrive does wonders for your soul!
